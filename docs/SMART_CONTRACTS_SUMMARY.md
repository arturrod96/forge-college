  - Update debt token status upon repayment
  - Fee collection (0.5% on repayments)
  - Repayment history tracking
  - Force repayment capabilities (testnet only)
  - Investor return distribution

### 7. **SponsorVault.sol**
- **Purpose**: Sponsor funding and impact metrics
- **Features**:
  - Sponsor registration and management
  - Sponsorship creation for cohorts or individual students
  - Impact metrics tracking (students funded, USD distributed, cohorts supported)
  - Fund allocation and distribution
  - Vesting logic placeholders for future enhancements

### 8. **MockUSDC.sol**
- **Purpose**: Test USDC token for Scroll Sepolia
- **Features**:
  - 6 decimal precision (like real USDC)
  - 1,000,000 initial supply to deployer
  - Mint/burn functions for testing
  - ERC-20 standard compliance

## 🔐 Access Control System

All contracts implement comprehensive role-based access control:

- **DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE**: Contract owner with full permissions
- **COHORT_MANAGER_ROLE**: Can manage cohorts and students
- **MENTOR_ROLE**: Can complete milestones and assess students
- **ORACLE_ROLE**: Can update student KPIs
- **PAYMENT_MANAGER_ROLE**: Can manage salary payments
- **REPAYMENT_MANAGER_ROLE**: Can process repayments
- **SPONSOR_MANAGER_ROLE**: Can manage sponsors and sponsorships
- **IMPACT_TRACKER_ROLE**: Can update impact metrics
- **MINTER_ROLE**: Can mint debt tokens
- **BURNER_ROLE**: Can burn debt tokens
